Overview 

With the creation and popularity of Wordle, the New York Times puzzle game, several spinoffs have been created and enjoyed by millions of users. Syn-dle is the newest addition to this word puzzle game genre. Users will be given more than just a blank screen full of boxes, they are given a synonym to help them figure out what the solution may be!

Game Description 

Objective: 

The objective of Syn-dle is to correctly solve the word puzzle based on the synonym provided and the information received after each guess. The solution is a 5-letter word that is a synonym of the word displayed on the screen. 

Gameplay: 

After starting Syn-dle, players will be presented with a random synonym to the 5-letter word that is the solution to the puzzle. They will be allowed 6 chances to guess the solution. Clues to the solution include the synonym and information they get about their guesses. After each guess, players will find out what letters they have correct and if they are in the correct position. Players will continue to guess until they reach the correct solution or use all 6 guesses. In a harder difficultly level, players will only be given information on correct letters in the correct place, not correct letters in an incorrect place. The player will have to use logic and reasoning to figure out what the solution could be.   

Controls: 

Users will use the mouse to select the start button or the difficulty button. The start button will take users to the gameplay screen, while the difficulty button will take users to the difficulty screen. On the difficulty screen, users will be able to select from normal or hard difficulty and then be taken to the gameplay screen. On the gameplay screen, users will be able to type in a guess based on the synonym shown on screen. Then, users will hit enter to submit their guess. If a guess does not have 5 letters, users will be prompted by the console to finish typing their guess. While the game is playing and after the user wins or loses, the replay button and exit button will be present on screen. The user can click the replay button to start back at the menu screen. The user can click the exit button to close the program.
